INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 * Place "makelatex" into a directory that is in your PATH. Make it executable (i.e., "chmod a+x makelatex").

If you run makelatex and get an error message "ImportError: No module named argparse" then you need to download the following file to the same location as you downloaded makelatex (but it does not need to be made executable): <a href="http://argparse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/argparse.py">argparse.py</a>
