v0.95
 * Major code reorganization: Integrate uconvert into makelatex so only the 'makelatex' script is needed.
 * Print a better warning message when prepost.sh script exists but isn't executable.
 * Keep makelatex-tmp directory if there was an error even if -k is not specified.
 * Add better support for bibentry package
 * makelatex now calls "./prepost.sh post-bibtex" every time that bibtex is called. This makes it possible to modify a .bbl file before before the document is created.
 * Removed --nowarn option; changed output to show number of warnings instead of the warnings themselves.
 * Better handle situation where pdffonts or pdfinfo are not installed.
 * Increase the number of checks we do to see if commands are installed before we try to use them.
 * Remove greyscale option due to ghostscript bug #693074

v0.94 - 12 Jun 2012
 * Use bibtex8 executable (if available) instead of bibtex
 * Added test documents: biblatex and \graphicspath
 * Fix Python 3 support, update testdoc script to ensure it doesn't happen again
 * Cleanup files in some error situations
 * Add --diff option to use latexdiff to show changes between two versions of a document.
 * Commented out bibcheck as it can be very verbose
 * Fix problem where .bst files in the same directory as the document were not used

v0.93 - 30 Apr 2012
 * Run even if TEXINPUTS or other environment variables are not set.
 * Works correctly when makelatex, uconvert, and uconvert.conf are in the same directory as the document (not installed).
 * Handle \graphicspath properly
 * Improve \include{} dependency checking
 * Run ps2pdf if fonts are not compact, not subsetted or not embedded.
 * If screen-quality PDF is larger than the original, use the original.
 * General code cleanup/consolidation
 * Detect when we need to rerun for beamer navigation
 * Parse log files in Python; remove grep dependency
 * chktex, lacheck, bibcheck support: checks for common errors
 * Specify engine using MAKELATEX_ENGINE environment variable
 * Support "% !TEX program = engine" (where engine is latex, pdflatex, etc.)
   directive in first if in first line of .tex file. It overrides all other
   engine selection mechanisms.


v0.92 - 27 Apr 2012

 * Extend non-ASCII check to .bib and .sty files

v0.90 - 26 Apr 2012
 * Initial release
