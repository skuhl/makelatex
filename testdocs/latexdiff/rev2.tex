This document demonstrates how \texttt{makelatex} works with the \texttt{latexdiff} tool to easily create PDFs which show what has changed between two~.tex files. This file is the second draft. This system works using the command \texttt{makelatex --diff rev1 rev2} and creates a file named makelatex-diff.pdf.

This paragraph was added in the second revision.
